# Swiffshot-iOS
Social App that combined Facebook Live &amp; Snapchat

Please note, this app is not mine and no longer works. I worked on this application from Feb 2017 to May 2017, rewriting major parts of the application as the Senior Engineer.

# Items I Built:

- Login
- Bug Reporting
- Home Screen (design not mine, most of the code is)
- Wowza views (design not mine, most of the code is)
- SSServer (100% mine, 75% of the server (non Wowza) code is located here, and the plan was to move more to this file)
- Notifications (about 50% code is mine)
